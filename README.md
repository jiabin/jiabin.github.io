### Important notes

Please don't edit files in `css` and `js` subdirectories as they are generated via [grunt][grunt]. You'll find source code in the src subdirectory!

### Installing grunt

This assumes you have [node.js][node] and [npm][npm] installed already.

1. Test that grunt is installed globally by running `grunt --version` at the
   command-line.
2. If grunt isn't installed globally, run `npm install -g grunt` to install
   the latest version. _You may need to run `sudo npm install -g grunt`._
3. From the root directory of this project, run `npm install` to install the
   project's dependencies.
